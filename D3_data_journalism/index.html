                <h2>Correlations Discovered</h2>
                <hr>
                <h3>Healthcare and Poverty</h3>
                <p>As you would expect, states with higher poverty levels have higher uninsured rates. This is
                    particularly pronounced in the Deep South and the Southwest. Meanwhile, only 4.6% of Massachusetts
                    residents are uninsured, by far the lowest of any state. That may be due to the implementation of
                    "RomneyCare" in 2006. (This dataset is from 2014, when its nationwide cousin "ObamaCare" had only
                    just been fully implemented.)</p>
                <h3>Obesity and Income</h3>
                <p>The low-income states in the Deep South and Mountain South also have the highest levels of obesity,
                    followed by a cluster of states in the Midwest. Coastal states tend to have higher median income and
                    lower obesity, but the state with slimmest population is landlocked: Coloradoans are famously
                    outdoorsy, which probably explains their outlier status.</p>
                <h3>Age and Smoking</h3>
                <p>The correlations here are fairly week, but it's notable that the notoriously vice-averse citizens of
                    Utah have by far the lowest smoking rates and median age. The Mountain South, which trends
                    relatively older, has the highest smoking rates, with West Virginia leading the pack (no pun
                    intended). Somewhat surprising is that North Carolina, home to Winston-Salem, bucks this trend.
                    Perhaps higher rates in its Appalachian west are offset by lower rates in its major metropolis
                    (Charlotte) and the Research Triangle.</p>
